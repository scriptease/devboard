See every dev server on your Mac, including the ones you forgot, and take them over.

A Bun server on `127.0.0.1:4242`, a vanilla JS page, a `devboard` CLI, and an optional Swift menu bar extra. It discovers listeners with `lsof` and `ps`, collapses each wrapper chain into one row, and can kill, start, restart, pin, group, and tail logs.

## Requirements

- macOS 14+
- Bun 1.2+
- `lsof`, `ps`, `git`, and `du` on PATH
- Xcode 16 or a Swift 6 toolchain only if you want the menu bar extra

## Quickstart

    bun install
    DEVBOARD_TRAY=0 bun run start
    # open http://127.0.0.1:4242

Start the board from your login shell so fnm/bun PATH is inherited by anything you launch from the page.

`devboard install` (optional) puts a `devboard` symlink in `~/.local/bin` and builds the menu bar app when Swift is present. Without installing, `bun run devboard -- <cmd>` is the same CLI. The tray is skipped when `swift` is missing; `bun run tray:build` builds it later.

    bun test
    bun run dev            # restarts on file change

After install, any terminal:

    devboard               # list what's on
    devboard ls --json     # same list as a JSON array
    devboard add web ~/Projects/app "bun run dev" 3000
    devboard pin 3000      # pin the running row on that port
    devboard open web-3000
    devboard rm web-3000
    devboard start api-3003
    devboard logs web -f
    devboard stop-all
    devboard doctor        # bun, lsof, ps, :4242, PATH, tray
    devboard up            # start the board if it is off
    devboard tray          # show the menu bar extra

## Environment

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `4242` | Port the board binds |
| `DEVBOARD_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Interface the board binds (e.g. `0.0.0.0` for LAN; pair with `config.json` below) |
| `DEVBOARD_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:4242` | Board the CLI talks to |
| `DEVBOARD_HOME` | `~/.devboard` | Pinned list, projects, presets, ignored ids, and logs |
| `DEVBOARD_TRAY` | unset (on) | Set `0` to start the server without the menu bar extra |

The menu bar extra reads `DevboardURL` from its Info.plist (default `http://127.0.0.1:4242`). Changing `PORT` or `DEVBOARD_URL` for an already-built tray needs `bun run tray:build` again.

`~/.devboard` holds `services.json`, `projects.json`, `presets.json`, `ignored.json`, and `logs/<id>.log`. Files are re-read on every request, so hand edits work without a restart.

Optional `~/.devboard/config.json` (re-read per request, never written by the board):

```json
{ "allowedHosts": ["192.168.1.20", "mymac.local"] }
```

Loopback (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `::1`) is always allowed and never needs listing. Entries accept bare hosts, `host:port`, or full URLs and are matched as hostnames. To serve the board off-loopback, set `DEVBOARD_HOST` (e.g. `0.0.0.0`) **and** list the connecting host here — otherwise requests get 403.

## Why

pm2 and Overmind supervise processes you handed them. Port-killer menu apps list listeners and can SIGKILL one. They do not collapse a `pnpm` → `next` → `next-server` chain into one row, pin a server you started from a terminal so you can stop and start it later, group a stack by project, or tail the log of something the board launched. That is the product.

## What it does

- **Discover.** `lsof` for listeners, `ps` for the process table. Each listener is walked up its parents while they are dev wrappers (node, bun, deno, npm, npx, pnpm, yarn, next, next-server, `sh -c`). The top wrapper is the root and one row. The walk never climbs into devboard itself, so services it started keep their own row.
- **Kill.** SIGTERM to every pid in the tree at once, SIGKILL to survivors after 3 seconds.
- **Pin.** Saves name, folder, command and port so the service can be started later. Matched to running rows by folder plus port, or folder plus port-stripped command when that match is unique. Switching an unsaved server off pins it first. A checked-in `devboard.json` is a pin template (not live status). Import it from + Add, a worktree card, Launch, or project Add from folder. Import never overwrites an existing pin.
- **Start / Restart.** Runs the saved command in its folder via `/bin/sh -c`, detached, output appended to `~/.devboard/logs/<id>.log`. Closing the board does not stop what it started. Optional restart-on-crash (5 tries, exponential backoff) relaunches a stopped server whose last log looks like an error. Stop and Kill disarm it.
- **Logs.** Last 4000 lines, refreshed every 2 seconds. Filter, jump between errors, follow the tail. Click a request id to trace it across the selected row's project (or every running `dev` row). Files exist only for services the board started. While the board is running, each file is capped at 5 MB (last 2 MB kept in `<id>.log.1`).
- **CLI.** `ls [--json]`, `add`, `rm`, `pin`, `open`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `logs [-f]`, `start-all`, `stop-all`, `doctor`, `up`, `tray`. `stop-all` pins unsaved running rows first, like the page. `doctor` reports bun, `lsof`/`ps`, who holds `:4242`, `~/.local/bin` on PATH, and the tray app.
- **Menu bar.** Count of servers on. Each row is a menu: Open, Restart, Stop, Copy run command, Logs (`?sel=<id>`). One notification when a service turns unhealthy or crash-restart gives up. Quitting the extra does not stop your servers. The tray bakes `DEVBOARD_URL` or `PORT` and the `package.json` version into Info.plist at `bun run tray:build`; rebuild to point it at another board.
- **Projects, worktrees, presets, attention, env.** Group servers, inventory git checkouts, resume a named set, surface port conflicts and crashed pins, edit env overrides.

The page layout, keys, and tokens live in `design.md`.

## Limits

- Logs exist only for services devboard started. A process you launched from a terminal keeps its output in that terminal; macOS gives no way to attach.
- Killing a **System** row (Postgres, Redis, ControlCenter) usually just makes launchd or Homebrew restart it. Use `brew services stop <name>`.
- Pins match a running row by folder plus port. If the listen port moved and exactly one running `dev` row has the same folder and the same command with the port flag stripped, the board adopts that row in the view and leaves the saved port alone.
- Log files rotate at 5 MB (last 2 MB kept) while the board is running. Deleting one is still safe.
- Health probes run only when you set a health URL. A server that logs every request to `/` will not see board traffic unless you ask for it.

## Tracing a request across services

devboard can follow one request through several log files when those services print a shared id. It does not guess from timestamps: child processes write straight to the log, so lines have no board-added time, and most dev servers print none.

Generate a request id in the front end per fetch, send it as `x-request-id`, log it, and forward the header in each server.

Next.js App Router:

```ts
export async function GET(req: Request) {
  const id = req.headers.get("x-request-id") ?? crypto.randomUUID();
  console.log(JSON.stringify({ requestId: id, path: req.url }));
  const res = await fetch(`${process.env.API_URL}/items`, { headers: { "x-request-id": id } });
  return Response.json(await res.json(), { headers: { "x-request-id": id } });
}
```

Hono:

```ts
app.use("*", async (c, next) => {
  const id = c.req.header("x-request-id") ?? crypto.randomUUID();
  c.header("x-request-id", id);
  console.log(JSON.stringify({ requestId: id, path: c.req.path }));
  await next();
});
```

Click an id in the log pane (UUID, 16+ hex, `req-…` / `req_…`, a W3C `traceparent` value, or a JSON `requestId` / `reqId` / `traceId` / `trace_id` / `correlationId` / `x-request-id`) to open Trace. Without a shared id, the board cannot link the lines.

## Security

Loopback only by default. The API kills process trees and runs saved shell commands. Binding off `127.0.0.1` (via `DEVBOARD_HOST`) exposes that power to the network with no auth — only do it on a trusted LAN, and only with `config.json` `allowedHosts` set.

Requests whose Host or Origin is not loopback (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `::1`), or whose `Sec-Fetch-Site` is present and not `same-origin` or `none`, get 403. Non-GET requests must be `application/json` (415 otherwise). There are no CORS headers.

Env overrides and log files under `~/.devboard` are plaintext local files (`0700` dir, `0600` files). The page masks secret-looking keys; starting a service still receives the real values.

## Smoke

`bash scripts/smoke.sh` drives the nine-step checklist against a throwaway `DEVBOARD_HOME`. It aborts if `:4242` or `:3999` is already taken. Last local run before this rewrite: 2026-09-10, passed.
